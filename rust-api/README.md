This folder contains the portion of the code from the Rust-API concerned with receipt parsing.

It is not runnable in this state, but is rather meant to provide an overview.


Some definitions for gRPC types used in the code can be found in `scan_receipt.proto`. Docs for gRPC can be found at `https://grpc.io/docs/`.
